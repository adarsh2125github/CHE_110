            <h2>Introduction to Biodiversity</h2>
            <p>
                Biodiversity, short for biological diversity, is the variety of life on Earth, including the different species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, as well as the ecosystems they form. It encompasses genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity and plays a crucial role in sustaining life and maintaining ecological balance.
